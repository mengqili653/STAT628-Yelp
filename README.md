## Project Introduction

Yelp is a widely used app in the United States that provide a platform for people to write reviews of businesses. The data contains the information of different businesses and customers reviews of these businesses. Our analysis focused on restaurants served desserts and our goal is to provide some useful insights and suggestions for businesses owner to help them improve their service.

## Repository Contents

* a `plot` folder contains plots in our project

* a `slides` folder contains slides and google slides link in our project

* a `report` folder contains the pdf report.

## How to run the code

Basically, we store every middle data file in the data folder, so you can run every script individually. 

The preprocess.ipynb and word_cloud.ipynb, word_cloud.R contains code to draw the word cloud. 

The score and ratio to score file contains code to use naive bayes to calculate the score. 

The join.ipynb is to simplify some procedure when writing shiny app.
