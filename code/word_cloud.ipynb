One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. \\n\\nLet me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \\n\\nAs far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\\n\\nMy dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \\n\\nWe ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \\n\\nSomething tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.</td>\n",

The atmosphere was great, the conversation was easy, the place wasn't too loud even though it was fairly busy and we were placed at the end of a long shared table. It didn't feel like we were crowded or encroaching on anyone else's space. There's even a nice patio out front; although, it was a bit too hot to sit outside on the particular night we went. We shared a cheese board with the server helping us pick our cheeses and I once again ordered a glass of Malbec since I enjoyed it the last time and it was his favorite. We then ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon (a domestic from California, though I don't remember what at the moment) and everything was very good. It was a wonderful evening though I never heard from him again so I'm starting to think maybe it was just a head full of yummy wine and an infatuation with this lovely little place ;) haha</td>\n",

       "0  The server had an extensive knowledge of wines & their various menu selections and it was clear that we were her top priority. The pizza and dessert were amazing. My only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable, I think they could add some more comfortable seating to give this more of a \"wine bar\" feel. Otherwise everything was amazing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1  If you come on a Friday or Saturday after 6 or 7pm, expect to have a bit of a wait. One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2  Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. \\n\\nLet me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \\n\\nAs far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\\n\\nMy dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \\n\\nWe ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \\n\\nSomething tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.   \n",
       "3  I absolutely knew I would love this wine bar from the moment I saw it from the outside! The decor is amazing and perfect, everything about it flows and it's very rustic modern looking. The wine was superb and we indulged in the house meatballs which were also delicious. The food was made out by the bar and you could tell it's very fresh and housemade. The wood fired pizzas looked amazing but we had other plans for dinner. All around beautiful and classy place that I'm very sad to have to leave behind!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4  I first visited Humble with my girlfriends shortly after it opened. We shared a cheese board, a Lardo pizza (with literal pieces of delicious fat on it) and a bottle of Malbec. It was a casual night that felt a little fancy. We were tucked in a nice little booth towards the front.\\nI recently went back on the most perfect date. The atmosphere was great, the conversation was easy, the place wasn't too loud even though it was fairly busy and we were placed at the end of a long shared table. It didn't feel like we were crowded or encroaching on anyone else's space. There's even a nice patio out front; although, it was a bit too hot to sit outside on the particular night we went. We shared a cheese board with the server helping us pick our cheeses and I once again ordered a glass of Malbec since I enjoyed it the last time and it was his favorite. We then ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon (a domestic from California, though I don't remember what at the moment) and everything was very good. It was a wonderful evening though I never heard from him again so I'm starting to think maybe it was just a head full of yummy wine and an infatuation with this lovely little place ;) haha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "0    The server had an extensive knowledge of wines & their various menu selections and it was clear that we were her top priority. The pizza and dessert were amazing. My only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable, I think they could add some more comfortable seating to give this more of a \"wine bar\" feel. Otherwise everything was amazing!,If you come on a Friday or Saturday after 6 or 7pm, expect to have a bit of a wait. One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.,Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. \\n\\nLet me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \\n\\nAs far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\\n\\nMy dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \\n\\nWe ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \\n\\nSomething tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.,I absolutely knew I would love this wine bar from the moment I saw it from the outside! The decor is amazing and perfect, everything about it flows and it's very rustic modern looking. The wine was superb and we indulged in the house meatballs which were also delicious. The food was made out by the bar and you could tell it's very fresh and housemade. The wood fired pizzas looked amazing but we had other plans for dinner. All around beautiful and classy place that I'm very sad to have to leave behind!,I first visited Humble with my girlfriends shortly after it opened. We shared a cheese board, a Lardo pizza (with literal pieces of delicious fat on it) and a bottle of Malbec. It was a casual night that felt a little fancy. We were tucked in a nice little booth towards the front.\\nI recently went back on the most perfect date. The atmosphere was great, the conversation was easy, the place wasn't too loud even though it was fairly busy and we were placed at the end of a long shared table. It didn't feel like we were crowded or encroaching on anyone else's space. There's even a nice patio out front; although, it was a bit too hot to sit outside on the particular night we went. We shared a cheese board with the server helping us pick our cheeses and I once again ordered a glass of Malbec since I enjoyed it the last time and it was his favorite. We then ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon (a domestic from California, though I don't remember what at the moment) and everything was very good. It was a wonderful evening though I never heard from him again so I'm starting to think maybe it was just a head full of yummy wine and an infatuation with this lovely little place ;) haha,Heard great things about this place so we had to check it out! Came here on a sunny afternoon and snagged a seat outside on one of the patio tables. The vibe of this place is classy but not overly stuffy. They have a gorgeous subway tiled brick oven behind the bar where they cook the pizzas. \\nThey had a large wine menu- beer and cocktails also available. We ordered 2 red wines (wines range from $7-12ish per glass or you can buy bottles). They don't have an extensive food menu but they have small plates, pizzas and cheese & meat boards available. We got the brussel sprouts & pancetta which were to die for. So buttery! We also ordered the clam pizza (dough was kind of too chewy for me but pizza tasted delicious otherwise). Our servers were extremely friendly and accommodating.  Definitely going to come back and try their happy hour!,I came here for the first time earlier this week and thought it was a good spot for a date or dinner out with friends. The staff was friendly, the food was ok, and the wine selection was good. I'm sure I'll be back again. \\n\\nWine: Albariño (yum)\\n\\nApps: The beet dish and the tuna dish were both quite good, though nothing especially memorable. I appreciated that the tuna dish was not too salty, which is rare to find in this city.\\n\\nPizza Margherita: I was disappointed with the quality of the pizza considering that they have a proper pizza oven. The dough itself was thicker than it should be and lacked the airy quality of true italian style pizza. The sauce was descent and the mozzarella they used was very good. The one thing I couldn't understand the were the slices of beefsteak tomatoes on top of the pizza...very odd.,My new favorite place. Just got home from our third visit to Humble Wine Bar in Lakewwood. Very comfortable place, we actually like sitting at the bar where you can watch the food being prepared. We've had the chicken pesto pizza, the shrimp pizza and the lardo pizza. All three were excellent, but the lardo is just heavenly. If your looking for pizza that tastes like bread with a ton of pizza sauce, this isn't the place for you. Humble's pizza's are thin crust and the toppings and cheese do all the talking. Really outstanding. Great selection of wines. Try the roasted artichokes, they are amazing. Love the location and the nice big windows. Excellent happy hour too.,Great Job Deagan!  Love the place....and as with Deagan's...I'll be back often!  :),Great place for wine and pizza!! They even have a vegan pizza!! It is so hard to find a place with vegan cheese and sausage.  Love going there for happy hour.  The outside seating is awesome too.,Not bad, but not really a wine bar as I expected one? More of a pizza place with a large wine selection. \\n\\nThe good: the Food! We had a white wine cheese plate and it was fantastic. The spinach brie pizza was also fantastic. The little Debbie themed truffles were amazing and spot on in taste! The wine was Ok, we had a red and a white, and the port  and sherry were also good with dessert. \\n\\nThe meh: the whole wine list was a name and a location, which told me nothing about the wine. A huge improvement would be describing the wine on the list and some suggested pairings would go a very long way. The wait staff knew a few of the wines, but could only describe a few, vaguely. \\n\\nOver all: go. it's fun, it's pricy, it's a high end pizza place with lots of wine.,Loved everything. Tried an old fashioned off the cocktail menu along with a cheese board (3 fantastic cheeses) and Brussels sprouts. Great service, too -- our waitress brought out two beer samples when my husband wasn't sure what to choose. We live on the east side but will be back to come here!,Stopped at Humble Wine Bar for their happy hour. Experience was great and pizza was awesome. Found a seat by the pizza oven and got to see the mad skills of the cooks with their pizza magic. Very relaxed chill spot. Staff was friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back.,Way too loud! Sound dampening needed ASAP! So crowded we couldn't get a table for hours, couldn't get served, couldn't hear to order. Will not go back.,I love the atmospher here.\\nAlso the pizza is very good and they have a decent size beer selection.\\nGreat place for a night out.,I adore, love, stalk and smother this place. Amazing. I can go on and on about how fantastic it is and you are checking this review to see if you should go. Well...go! Gorgeous interior, large attentive bar, outdoor seating. Great for a girls night, after work, first date, romantic before or after anything. Sometimes we will be out to dinner elsewhere and it's time for dessert so we skip and come to humble for more wine and their amazing desserts instead! The chocolate tower by far is the best cake I've had at any restaurant and the peanut butter ice cream on top I want to bathe in. The humble pie and rasberry crime brûlée which is a cake not a traditional brûlée are to die for. \\nAll of the food is delicious and the pizza (when I ate gluten) was perfectly made. If I had one criticism it would be to add a couple more gluten friendly/paleo options (grain free) like mussels...that would be amazing. In all honestly, it's a great place with a large wine menu, perfect atmosphere for any occasion and delicious food and desserts!,This is my new favorite wine bar, hands down. Immediately upon entering, I felt the stress of the day leave me. A warm fire from the stone pizza oven was ablaze, chandeliers made of wine bottles decorated the booths, and rustic bar and table tops were scattered throughout the restaurant. We sat at the bar, right in front of the fire. We ordered the best winter sangria I've ever tasted--my friend described it best \"like a cold mulled wine\" which sounds awful but is actually amazing. We each had a glass and split the 4-cheese pizza. I found a slice (or 3) of heaven that afternoon and definitely plan on going back to see what else I can fall in love with.,Fortunately this place has a broad menu. Do yourself a favor and go to Harlow's for Neopolitan-style pizza. \\n\\nThe pros: \\nGood location\\nFriendly service\\nNice decor\\n\\nThe cons:\\nBland pizza\\n\\nNot sure how the rest of the menu is, but I didn't enjoy the pizza. I had the margherita. The crust was overcooked and flavorless. I felt like I was eating an inch-thick saltine. It left a cardboardy taste in my mouth. The sauce was mlegh.. The tomatoes were mlegh.. Everything was mlegh..,What an adorable place! I've been dying to try it out, and it did not disappoint. Wine prices were typical for a wine bar- would recommend getting a bottle for the best pricing. I tried the white blend by recommendation from our waitress, and it was exactly what I wanted. Their goat cheese stuffed peppadews were delicious and I would go back again just for the stuffed artichokes! Great decor and I've heard the pizzas are amazing. I could sit on the outdoor patio for hours, can't wait to return!,I'll start with what I like. The most unique thing that I love, is their cheese and salumi. Not that I haven't seen this at a bar before but the fact that I have the option to pick and choose different ones from different regions is pretty cool. I would like to know if they actually shop around for it or get it from WSM. Their pizza was respectable. I like the craftiness and the seasoned oven. As said before not the traditional thin Neapolitan you would expect, still very flavorful.\\nOverall, I like the route they went and goes great for a wine bar experience. Wine selection is nice, unique cocktails, and craft brews from the bottle and draft.\\n\\nMy pet peeve of this place is that they have only one style of wine glass. Which is a narrower glass, I prefer a wider body for my reds.\\n\\nI've only been at the bar, therefore I must say service could be better. I usually get handed a menu immediately which is good, then I'm almost forgotten about. Place my order, get my order then I'm really forgotten about. I have yet to asked how my food is. I don't get offered a second drink until they pick up plates, which at that point I'm read yet to move on to bigger and better things.\\n\\nIf you like a wet experience the following is for you. Be careful sitting in front of the wine taps, because when that keg blows you will get a shot to the face.  this did happen to me, the keg blew and wine got on me. He pour ended up being a half glass of bottom of the keg wine. The bartender offered me the glass,I said sure. Come to find out she charged me full price for it. The  kegged wine average wine with a huge markup. \\n\\nI will agree the price are high for what you get. Which is really my only real con for why I wouldn't go there. I would love to spend more money there, I just need to have a more pleasing experience, and that every dollar is worth it, and as of now it's not. Whether the price point is better or service or something new, humble is my 'I want to relax quietly somewhere with a glass of wine' place,Had dinner at the bar. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the entire cheese selections. We were lucky to sit in front of the fiery pizza oven! Anything that can out looked so amazing, we had to order a lardo pizza. It was \"buttery\", cheesy, and just sweet enough for consumption of its entirety. Definitely will come back to order off the rest of the menu,Had dinner here last night and was very impressed.  The atmosphere was very cool and even though they were quite busy, everyone was nice and the service was great.  The husband and I shared oysters which were great (the pepper mignonette was delicious) and the cauliflower antipasti which was not great.  The cauliflower had waaaaaayyyyyyyy too much vinegar on it.  Both of us had pizzas for our meal.  Mine was the vegan sausage and mozzarella pizza and he had the real sausage pizza.  Both of us loved them.  Excellent crust and taste.  Very good wine list and decent beer list for a wine bar.  Their cocktails are delicious.  I need to spend more time in Lakewood.,Excellent wine selection, food and service. I really enjoy the environment, very chic place. Reasonable prices. If you go, you have to try the spinach and Brie pizza.,I went here for after dinner drinks with one of my girl friends the other night. It is located the trendy Lakewood area with plenty of street parking. The immediate ambiance is intimate with dim lighting, strings of lights, high top tables and the bar that runs along the back wall. Very cozy and cute. They have a small patio area too, we originally began at a high top but moved to one of the three community tables on the patio. Since it is smaller it may be too crowded for my preference on weekends so a week day night was perfect.\\n\\nOnto the wine! They offer an extensive lists of bottles and also wines by the glass. We ordered a bottle of a sparkling rose, Albrecht Cremant as well as the white wine cheese tray. The wine was excellent, perfect to enjoy on a warm night on their patio. The cheese tray was good too, however, it seemed like only two servers were there so we ended up drinking an entire glass of wine before the tray got to the table, maybe 25 minutes. When it arrived though it was well worth the wait! The Brie, cheddar and Grayson were my favorites. Wonderfully complimented the wine. The pizzas that tables around us were ordering looked delicious too! \\n\\nI can't wait to come back regularly during the summer! Overall this place is great for a casual wine night. I would highly recommend it.,I love this place. The happy hour is amazing $5 glasses of wine, 3 cheeses for $10 for a cheese board and the pizzas are phenomenal! I adore their patio and this is definitely going to become a go to place for me. Our server Shea was one of the best servers I have come across in a while, honest recommendations, very sweet and has a wonderful sense of when to check in on a table. Would recommend if you're in the lakewood area looking to try a local establishment.,Great atmosphere for a relaxed night out. Our server was very helpful with picking out a wine and extremely patient with us. We also had the red wine cheese board which came with 4 cheeses, jam, oil, crackers, and breads.,We love this place! It's warm, inviting and entertaining! Watching the pizza masters at work is awesome! The bartenders are always attentive and engaging. Not only is the pizza amazing but so are their small plates. It's a great date spot!,I would start out by saying that in atmosphere, selection, and general logistics this is a wine bar for people who don't actually like wine bars. It's a little more emphasis on the bar, and less emphasis on the wine.\\n\\nThere isn't a very large wine selection for someplace that calls itself a wine bar. That being said there were some great selections and the price is pretty middle of the road. \\n\\nThey do offer some craft beer selections a few of which are unique and not your typical beer kind of choices, but it certainly is not a beer and shot kind of place if you couldn't tell by the name already.\\n\\nThe menu is limited like most wine bars, but they offer pizzas (which considering they are made in a beautiful pizza oven are only just mediocre) in addition to meat and cheese boards. The cheese selections are great from what I saw, they featured a lot of cheeses that I'm a big fan of. There is antipasti and some small plates, but those just seem a little random and disjointed and if I didn't see so many good reviews of said dishes I'd recommend they ditch them. They don't really go with pizza, and few of them would properly accompany a meat or cheese board. They mainly seem like things you might order if you were grabbing a glass of wine and some snacks for happy hour.\\n\\nThe ambiance is loud, like a typical bar/restaurant you'd see in an urban neighborhood like Ohio City or Tremont. There was pretty loud music. It's a cool place to go if you aren't looking for anything too intimate or for someplace to really talk because it's a bit more social than that. \\n\\nI probably wouldn't go back mostly because I would prefer someplace a little more intimate and with a large wine selection. That being said I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend looking for a lively place to enjoy a glass of wine and some small plates.,Amazing flatbread pizzas, cheese and meat boards, and basically everything I have tried here! Ambiance and decor are beautiful, especially when sitting at the bar in front of the hearth. Servers are very knowledgable about the wine and food, and the cooks are friendly and fun to watch in the open kitchen area. This place is on par with many big city trendy neighborhood restaurants- I'm glad we have our very own in Lakewood!,For my wife and I, Humble has it all! From the Wine, Beer and Cocktails to the salads, cheese selections, great thin crust pizza. We have always had a great time, especially when you can grab a bar seat in front of the oven! \\nHumble is also located directly in the heart of Cougarville! Always lots of ladies there!,After a hectic Saturday, my husband and I walked down to Humble Wine Bar around 10PM last night for a glass of wine. Our server was knowledgeable and really took the time to go over the wine menu with us. I appreciated the fact that I could see he was busy and moving quickly, yet when he came to our table he slowed things down and was sincerely happy to serve us. We hadn't planned on ordering food as it was so late, but it smelled amazing in there and everything on the menu sounded so good. We decided to split the flatbread with herbed ricotta. This was to die for! The bread was thick and chewy, but also crisp, airy, and perfectly seasoned. I got a glass of Rickshaw Pinot Noir and my husband got the Malbec. Mine was nice, but my husband and I agreed the Malbec was one of the best we've had. We cannot wait to come back for dinner and try the pizzas! Humble Wine Bar is gorgeous inside and out and we are so glad that such a wonderful place has opened in our neighborhood.,We had been wanting to stop by here for some time - finally made it.\\n\\nWe went on a Saturday around 4:30.....hoping to beat the crowd.  We did!  It was very full with people waiting when we left!\\n\\nNice wine list but could be a bit more extensive and good beer selection.  We had a glass of the Paul Dolan Cabernet - which was \"on tap.\"\\n\\nThey have wood fired pizzas and great cheese and meat trays.  The waitress helped us select several different cheese for a cheese tray that came with fig jam, raw honey, nuts, homemade crackers, and a small baguette.  We had a dessert that was unremarkable.\\n\\nSeating was at the bar, at high tables and at low tables.  The decor was interesting - punched metal ceiling, white brick walls......very inviting and yet chic!\\n\\nWe would return for the ambiance, the cheese, and another glass of that \"on tap\" wine!,Humble is one of my favorite places in Lakewood. The limited beer list is always good. Most recently been drinking the Columbus Bodhi Imperial IPA which is a fantastic beer. The patio is relaxing and always good people watching with the constant parade of strange agents roaming Lakewood. Most recently came here with my mom before she went on a vacation for a drink and pizza. The pizza has changed for the better. On first visit when the restaurant opened, it was more in the Neapolitan style with giant slices of fresh mozzarella and basil. On my last visit, there was grated mozzarella as a base with the large fresh slices of cheese on top. It was more similar to a New York style than Crostatas. I prefer this over a regular Neapolitan.,I absolutely adore Humble. The food is always beyond delicious and the drinks are made with love. I had the mushroom and artichoke pizza and it blew my mind. The decor is crisp and clean. The staff is friendly and attentive. Two thumbs up on all fronts.,Gone on a few dates and to see friends here 3 times now. The owner are down to earth and staff goes the extra mile.,Had two different stone fired pizzas. Both were amazing. The atmosphere and staff were excellent. Looking forward to coming to Humble often!,If you are looking for the perfect place to hold a special event, please call Mandi Bernot at Lakewood's Humble Wine Bar where we just had our daughter's shower.  The food is outstanding.  Mandi and her staff provided exceptional service.  No detail was forgotten. The decor is beautiful.  Truly exceeded our expectations.  \\nMichelle C.,Not only is the wine delicious-- there is quite an amazing selection! If you are unsure what to get, the staff is extremely knowledgable in guiding you in the direction you should go in based on your tastes. I've yet to try some of the main course meals, but the small starter courses such as the cheese plates (etc) are a delicious compliment to the wines! If you go during the summer, there are usually some summer specials of fruity flavored sangrias and wines that are perfect for summer nights. It's a great atmosphere to grab some friends and head out for a drink.,Calling this a \"wine bar\" is a bit of a misnomer.  Yes, there is an extensive wine list, as well as other cocktails and even a reasonable selection of unusual bottled beer.  However, this is more of a gourmet pizza and small plates restaurant than an actual \"wine bar\".  The \"bar\"  itself is pretty small and not separated in any way from the rest of the restaurant, which is overall tiny, loud, crowded and um, kinda ugly (white butcher paper covering cheap tables).  I guess that's the \"humble\" part as my usual \"wine bar\" experience is something elegant, quiet and maybe a bit snobbish that would not be so popular in a down-to-earth place like Lakewood. \\n\\nAs happy as I am to have a decent restaurant centrally located in this strip of businesses - which have that miracle of miracles for Lakewood, an ample free parking lot (gasp!) in the back -  I wonder why the proprietor did not seek to place his business in an actual vacant bar or restaurant, or at least in a space that could accommodate a LARGE bar and be quiet and spacious enough that you did not have to yell across a three-foot dinner table at your companion to be heard.  This is not the place I'd go to enjoy a quiet, restful glass of wine or a drink of any sort. It's more on the order of happy hour in Ohio City. \\n\\nI still give it four stars because once you get past the noise, the uncomfortable tables, and your internal image of a \"wine bar\" as something much more peaceful, the food and wine here are top notch.  If your idea of a pizza is something with an excellent thin crust and ingredients that don't taste like they're loaded with sugar or came out of a can, then check this place out.  You can watch them rolling out the pizza and see that the process here is more akin to trained chefs than to bored teens throwing some dough in an oven. There are also awesome charcuterie and cheese plates where you can sample all sorts of tasty hors d'oeuvres, spreads, nuts, meats and cheeses, and a selection of fancy desserts.  The wine and other drinks are just the icing on the top of this most excellent cake.  The wait staff are more professional than the norm for Lakewood, and they even have a selection of pizza, dessert and wine available for takeout.  \\n\\nOnly reason I knocked off a star is the logistics of the dining room. As I noted above, during busy times it gets loud, crowded, and uncomfortable, and to make matters more annoying they usually don't take reservations and when you show up, if they are running a wait list, they have some policy of refusing to give you any idea of how long a wait you're looking at.  They can't even seem to tell you if you're looking at, say, 15 minutes or an hour. I imagine this is to encourage you to go wait in the bar and spend money on their wine instead of going elsewhere, but when the restaurant is crowded the bar is not a real pleasant place to hang out (no room and very noisy).  I would suggest looking through the large front windows upon arrival to see how busy the place is, and if it looks packed, go somewhere else.  If you see empty tables, by all means go on in there and eat and drink.,One of my favorite places to go for pizza. Crisp, thin crust. Also lots of great small plates. Great outdoor dining when the weather is nice and cozy when it isn't. Very fresh, contemporary interior. Lots of parking behind the building, off the street. Good wine and beer offerings. My only complaint is that it can be soooo loud in there, but that is the case with so many restaurants these days.,I really enjoy the atmosphere in this place. I got the margarita pizza, it was very good. I have always had a place in my heart for wood oven baked pizza. The cheese was also very fresh and very good. I think they are a little on the pricey side, but it is okay every now and then.\\nI felt so cool and hip eating here :),The atmosphere inside is nice, outside okay but the main road takes away from it. Ordered a salad and didn't realize had an ingredient my GF was allergic to, sent it back and they did not take off the bill....unreal...someone else would have ate it if we knew that. Also ordered the flatbread, I would have got more enjoyment if I just lit the $10 bill on fire. I figured I would try somewhere new, but Rocky River wine bar is the only wine bar you need to know about.,LOVE Humble - such a great vibe!  The atmosphere is inviting and the menu offers a nice array of small plates and perfectly sized oven-fired pizzas. Thoroughly enjoyed the fig and prosciutto pizza and the oysters on the half shell were outstanding.  Service was attentive and our seat in front of the pizza oven was perfect!  Definitely will be back.,I've come here about 7 times, and it is consistently fantastic, flavorful, perfectly prepared food. \\n\\nTonight I ordered the prosciutto caprese and shrimp pizza to go (side note: I asked for light cheese, and although they request no substitutions to their pizzas, this was ok. Score).  Food was prepped and ready within 15 minutes, staff was friendly and attentive.  \\n\\nThird time w the shrimp pizza. The flavors are balanced and I love their fresh mozzarella with the sun dried tomatoes. If you like shrimp, this is a must try. \\n\\nThe prosciutto caprese - little pinwheels of mozzarella and prosciutto, large ripe tomatoes (red and yellow tonight) with balsamic, basil leaves and bread sturdy enough to hold it. I've debated just ordering 2 or 3 these a few times. One of my favorite meals anywhere. Great twist on the traditional caprese. Would like a few more basil leaves, but it's ok without. \\n\\nAlso tried the margherita pizza, chicken pesto, the artichokes and Brussels sprouts. Pleased with it all,My friend and I came here to enjoy a drink after dinner on a Saturday night. Next time I'll come here for dinner as well since the food coming from the kitchen looked and smelled amazing. \\n\\nThe inside of the bar is clean and aesthetically pleasing. There is an outdoor patio in front, high-top tables inside, and a long bar at the back. We sat at the bar since we were just there for a drink. The service from the bartender that night was good. She greeted us as soon as we sat down and kept water glasses full as we enjoyed our drinks.\\n\\nWe both went with Red Sangria which was delicious. It came out in a large wine glass that was almost full. It was a nice sized drink for the price. The drink had plenty of sweetness.,Humble Wine Bar, it's a step up from a local pizzeria, with their gourmet pizzas. A bit of fancy, with their wine selection, cocktails, and charcuterie/cheese board options. It's the perfect blend of casual neighbor pizza joint meets luxe wine bar.\\n\\nThe menu list is short but, there is something for all kinds of \"eaters\" ..... picky, meat, veggie. The food is simple but, will appease any dustinguished epicurean's palate. They have some small plate options if you don't want pizza as an entree. Pair it with a salad and you won't leave hungry.\\n\\nThe wait staff is attentive and can help you pair items that will compliment each other.\\nSo far, I've been really happy with their suggestions and have tried things I might not normally pick like, the Creminelli Bresaola (beef cured meat).\\n\\nThe only thing I've been on the fence about is their cocktails. The drink list is definitely innovative, but nothing wowed me. I've had the Bee's Knees, their Moscow Mule, and Spiced Sangria all were pretty descent.\\n\\nI love this place, they've made me a happy customer, and it's my new go to spot for a nice dinner!,I love love love this place and I had review.  I have been here many times now and the food never disappoints.  The staff is efficient and helpful when needed.  The bartender did an amazing job, she was spot on with our cocktails.  Frequenting bars around the area, I have not found a better mojito any where else.  A definite must have!  The Cosmo was not too shabby either.  Add this place to your late stops for a quick dessert before heading home.  (Secret they don't encourage changes to the food, but if you ask nicely, they will do custom orders)  Don't walk run to humble!  Perfect for late night dates!,This was a super nice wine bar. We were able to score a seat on the patio which was lucky because inside was way too noisy to have a discussion. Had a glass on tap and it was excellent! Very fresh and delicious. We also snacked on olives while we waited for our fire cooked pizza. Very delicious pizza and overall pleasant experience. We will be back again:),I love the cute rustic decor of this place!\\n\\nI've always had to wait at least 30 minutes when I come here, but I feel that is pretty common for most places in Lakewood around dinner time. \\n\\nThey have a great wine list (along with other cocktails) and plenty of cheese boards and small plates. When I come here, I always get a pizza. Their pizza's are the best! (There's a huge oven right behind the bar that you can watch the pizza's bake in) It is a thinner crust pizza similar to Bar Cento's pizzas. SO good!,I wanted to go out for some brick oven style pizza a few weeks back, and I didn't want to go too far. My wife also wanted to get a fancy cocktail so instinctively we went to Players. Well that didn't go so well, you can read my review. \\n \\nFor some reason I forgot that we had Humble now. I really like this place. We came here a couple weeks after that other experience and was very pleased. The staff was helpful and friendly, the cheese and cold cut plate we got was awesome, and the pizza was spot on. The outdoor seating was great. We were able to watch the band playing at the library that Friday night. Also, the fancy drinks were very good. I am definitely making this my go to fancy pizza place in Lakewood.,I really wanted to like Humble. I'm a big supporter of Lakewood businesses. I live in Lakewood. Alas, after two visits, I am not impressed. For a wine bar, the wine list is meager and mediocre in its selection. The service is perfunctory at best and my friend and I had to repeatedly hunt down our server. The bartender was not engaging and seemed put out by our request for another round of drinks. The menu is limited--fine for a wine bar, but in that case why can't they pay attention to the details and put out some decent basics? For example, the Caeser salad was simply awful. Bagged pale-hued pre-cut lettuce from Marcs (saw it on the service counter), minimal dressing short on lemon and parmesan cheese, flavorless really, absolutely no kick. The wood-fired pizzas are okay but for $14 a pop for a medium-sized pie they ought to be memorable. Where's the use of herbs and olive oil? The crust is tasteless (at least add some salt, guys) and the toppings so-so. Sorry, guys, this is a miss for me. I won't be returning.,Humble is a MUST STOP on Detroit. Even if you are not a fan of wine, they have numerous choices of cocktails and beer, and of course DELICIOUS food. The atmosphere inside is very art deco and modern..really cool and the best part is the outside patio off Detroit with about 4 large picnic tables.  On our adventure here we had 2 salads: the normal house and a Cesar. I was really disappointed in the Cesar- way tooo fishy!! We than split the spicy sopressata which was delicious! (Basically its a pepperoni pizza-not spicy) Along with our meal we had a bottle of the Hidden Crush Chardonnay which was a perfect pairing!! Can't wait to come back!,The last time I was at Humble we sat at the bar right in front of the pizza oven. After seeing all of the glorious pizzas coming out of the oven, I want to go here all the time and eat pizza and drink wine and never leave.,This was the second time that I have been there, and it was was great. I have not had a bad experience there yet. We sat at the bar, and it was later, so we weren't too hungry, so I just got a salad, and a few glasses of wine. The bartender was very attentive, the restaurant was sparkling clean, and the fire from the oven felt great (it was a cold night in March). Next time I go, I am going to go for dinner and experience the full menu.,This is our go-to place for closing out our date nights before we head home. Very cozy and relaxing environment. Great options for wine and a nice beer list. Food is tasty - both little snacks like the oven-toasted nuts or bigger snacks like the pizzas. We love to sit at the bar close to the oven on cold nights.,Humble is an excellent addition to the Lakewood food and bar scene.  It's a cozy place located on Detroit Rd.  As of now, they don't take reservations.  I met my friend there on a Saturday night around 7:30.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table.  There is a bar, but it is also small.  If you are planning to go with a larger group, try to go during an off time if you don't like to wait.  That being said, I think Humble is totally worth the wait!  I think the menu is geared towards sharing with your group.  They offer a few salads, various small plates, meat and cheese boards, as well as pizza.  My friend and I split the mushroom pizza and some roasted Brussels sprouts.  We also ordered a few glasses of wine (it is a wine bar, after all).  Our waitress was quite knowledgeable of the wines and led us to the perfect wintery white.  You should definitely check out this new spot!,Food is decent. It has good presentation but lacks flavor. The wine list is limited and pricey. Also, the place is very loud. It is very hard to have conversations without raising your voice.,Humble definitely follows the trend happening in Lakewood away from the dive bar scene and more into gastropub type places. This area of Lakewood specifically is following that trend, I'm sure thanks to Melt. Lakewood owes Matt Fish a big high five. \\n\\nWe went for happy hour, which ends at 6p and is only at the bar. I disapprove. It was a beautiful day outside, but everything we wanted was on the happy hour menu and a great deal, so we skipped the big patio and headed inside. \\n\\nThings were great from there. The wine was delicious and for once I can say I might have liked a Merlot more than a cab. I was starving, but it was too early for real dinner, so we just had a pizza at the bartenders recommendation. It was mushroom and it was awesome (and big!). The bartender was also great, super chatty and knowledgeable. I hate when bartenders don't know what they are talking about (*cough*greenhousetavern*cough) the  non happy-hour prices are definitely on the high end, so you expect a higher level of service and we got it!\\nThey do seem to have a large cocktail menu if that's your thing and wine on tap. How can a place be bad with wine on tap?,I think I could eat these roasted artichokes every day for the rest of my life!  Also, the Humble pie is outstanding.  Even the cheese pizza was delicious!  Seriously, eating here was almost depressing because it reminded me how much better all the rest of what I eat could be.\\n\\nMy jalapeno cocktail, however, was a disappointment.  Not spicy at all.  I guess that's what I get for ordering a cocktail at a wine bar.,Humble is one of our go to restaurants and we are here 2-4 (or more) times a month. The service has always been great. \\n\\nWe even have our \"usual\" order which everyone seems to already know. Caesar salads (extra anchovies) and sausage pizza...but sometimes we switch it up with the fig and prosciutto pizza. \\n\\nWe always return to Deagan's and Humble because the food and service are always great. Thank you!,Love this place! Nice wine selection and delicious signature cocktails. If you are getting food, don't miss out on their wood fired pizza. The mushroom one is our favorite, but we haven't had one we didn't like. Great staff. They are really friendly and accommodating. So glad to have this place local.,I like having a wine bar in Lakewood now and it's a great location. The pizza here is amazing. I recommend going with a few people, we were able to order one of everything to try it out. The margarita pizza was so good. The staff here is so friendly and always offer to have to owner come help with your wine selection.,I love it! What a wine bar. There's this pizza wood stone pit dead center of the bar. The wine is great but their craft beer is even better! A must go!,I visited here last Friday with my gentleman friend. We sat on the patio and enjoyed a cheese plate, which was top-notch. Delicious. We ordered cava and it was outstanding. We each ordered 2 glasses since we loved it.\\n\\nWe'll be back to try more of the menu and drink more cava!,Love, love LOVE Humble Wine Bar! This is our new go-to date-night spot. It's airy yet warm and intimate, they have great drinks in addition to the wine (Moscow Mule in a copper mug, anyone?), and their food is great. I love the Beet salad and the pizzas are REALLY great! It surprised me how good they were. We've been there twice now, and every time we get a night out we consider going back.\\n\\nService has always been spectacular. Picture this: the friendly faces of Deagan's with a slightly elevated (although smaller) menu. We've gotten great recommendations on both wine and food. One time we went and explained that we were going to spend a lot of time there, and the meal was paced accordingly. We didn't feel rushed or weird and the dishes didn't overlap in that annoying way (unless we requested them to). At Deagan's, I feel as though something's lacking service-wise, though I can't put my finger on it. But at Humble, they do it just right. Highly recommend.,I wish I could leave more than 5 stars! This was such an amazing experience, service and food wise. My girlfriend and I went for the happy hour and started with a pitcher of white sangria which was to die for. Our server, Allison, was so great. She offered us fresh basil to add to our pitcher of sangria making it that much better and knew so much about the menu making ordering so easy- considering we are two of the most indecisive people I know. We got the oysters and ceasar salads- both which were awesome. We also got the pizza special which was to die for. Everything was so great, I would go back tomorrow. Maybe even tonight! And we just left!,I have been here twice now, and it's not going to take me long to become a regular. The place itself is absolutely beautiful on the inside, and I've been lucky enough to sit on the patio which is just as nice. The select of wine is insane, the only downfall is that they don't have any sweet red wines if that's what you like. If you like sangria their red and white are both delicious and it's $30 for a pitcher, which ends up being about 6 glasses. Both times I have gone I have gotten their pizza because I have always heard great things about it and I haven't been disappointed. If you are looking for good food, wine and atmosphere then I highly recommend here!,Really liked this place!  \\n\\nTook my boyfriend after work - we got one of the pizzas, and the cheese plate, as well as some wine. Felt the price was in line with the quality of food, and really liked the atmosphere - feels a little upscale and different, but not snobby or pretentious. \\n\\nStaff was very friendly, and answered questions well.  Will go back for sure!,Great pizzas and wine selection. My wife and I came on our first date and it's been history ever since. The atmosphere is very calming and relaxing. We've never had anything less than exceptional service at Humble. Plenty of parking in the back as well as on Detroit. Prices are pretty fair for what you'd expect at a wine bar. For the dude's that aren't wine drinkers there is a small, but good selection of draft beers. Their craft cocktails are great too - especially the Moscow Mule's. Cheers!,Loved this wine bar! First off, the interior is beautifully done and the details are perfect! I love the huge garage sized doors that open up to the patio. Design is impeccable. \\n\\nThe wine selection is great and the food is so good! I loved the hot stone oven that's visible from the dining area. They have good happy prices on wines too. $5 a glass for wine that tastes just right and not cheap. I will definitely be back!!!,Humble Wine Bar is far and away one of my favorite spots in Lakewood. The atmosphere is wonderful, from the rustic mason jars of wildflowers on each table to the whimsical lights on the patio, and the wine bottle chandeliers. Each time I have been there, the servers have been knowledgeable about the wine list and able to make excellent recommendations. My most recent visit was a girl's night in July to celebrate my sister's birthday. There was a group of four of us, and although the bar was crowded we only waited about 10 minutes for a table. We ordered the margherita pizza and the shrimp pizza and both were fantastic. I've also had the lardo pizza, which is actually my favorite. Our server was attentive but not overbearing and we did not have the feeling that we were being rushed. I am a junkie for a good wood-fired pizza and theirs are some of the best I've had. Other things that rock about Humble? The parking in the back (which, if you live in Lakewood, you know the parking struggle is real), the picnic tables on the patio, and the open kitchen. My only complaint (and it's a small one) is that the restroom is a single, so there is often a line, which is mildly annoying. Highly recommend this place for a date night, birthday celebration, girl's night, or happy hour.,Sometimes you get lucky and stumble on a new favorite place, completely by accident. After a not-so-great dinner close by, my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to cozy up for an after dinner drink or two. Lucky for us, Humble caught our eye. \\n\\nWe grabbed a table inside, near the roaring wood fired oven. The decor was modern and clean, with just the right amount of cozy. For a Friday night, it was busy, but not crowded. Busy enough to know this is a great spot, but not so crowded and loud that you can't have a conversation or find somewhere to sit. \\n\\nI thought the wine list was great- they had a full page of wines by the bottle and a nice sized selection of wines by the glasses. We decided to split a bottle, we agreed that the price was pretty fair. We didn't order any food this time, but we did enjoy watching the pizzas come out all bubbly and smelling amazing from that beautiful oven. It was a great atmosphere to relax and sip some wine with my beau. \\n\\nWe liked our first experience so much that we came back only a week later. This time in the late afternoon (they open at 4pm). We snagged two bar seats by the oven this time, so we got to watch the chefs making the pizzas. We decided to get food this time and, based on a chef's suggestion, went with the brussels sprouts and a pizza to split (can't remember which one). The sprouts were amazing. They were roasted and tossed with crispy pancetta and a vinaigrette. The pizza was straight from the oven hot, with a crispy crust and the perfect amount of toppings. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back and try more of their delish menu and drink more wine. Its definitely a place I'll bring my parents when they visit and somewhere I'll remember for my beau and I's next date night.,This is a great little wine bar -- it's cozy, has great ambiance, and even has a vegan pizza option (more please!). The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars -- they are very wasteful. Every table is covered in paper and discarded with every customer, even if they're not soiled. Replace the paper with a cleaning cloth, it's 2017!,Had to wait a very long time for a table because no reservations but we loved our meal. Their wood fire pizzas are amazing & the wine was perfect! Great new place.,I decided to try this place during Happy Hour. They have a cheese plate available for $10 and $2 off their pizzas - not to mention the $5 glasses of wine and cheap cocktails!  The fig jam that comes on the cheese plate is so delicious.  The pizza was harder to pick because there were so many delicious options. Finally, I went with the fig and prosciutto pizza. Perfect balance of salty and sweet. I will be coming again! I'm excited to try sitting on the patio on a nicer night.,This place was awesome! I love the decor. The menu is a bit limited if your looking for food only, but the wine and beer menu was great and the pizzas we tried were too. In particular the fig & prosciutto pizza that the server recommended was AMAZING!! I will definitely be coming back for that.,Humble is a decent place for a little bit of wine and a little bit of cheese. The wine list is ample, with something for everyone. The cheeseboards are large enough to feed two people, and the pizzas are pleasant. The rest of the food isn't necessarily somthing I would go out of my way for, though. A little too heavy and pub-like. However, the atmosphere is very trendy, and if you can forgive the volume on a busy night, it's quite fun!\\n\\nStop in for their happy hour! That's when you'll get the best deals.,Came here for a bachelorette party. Evidently, they don't take reservations. The wait was quoted at 30 minutes. We waited 2 hours before calling it quits. The bride had to open gifts in the hallway next to the restroom. The bartender was rude; the hostesses were indifferent to our special occasion. Definitely will not be coming back.,Met some girlfriends here one night and it was great. I was a little late to the party so I only ordered a glass of wine but my friends all had the pizza and sangria and raved about it. I really enjoyed the ambiance. I'm anxious to come back and try the food actually. I'll update this once I do!,I met who is now my boyfriend, there for the first time on a blind date. We were those 2 people that sat there after the last of the other people had left. We didnt even realize they had been closed 20 minutes before we looked around and noticed there was not a soul but us. They didnt turn up the lights, they didnt make us uncomfortable, they just patiently waited for us to leave. Which we quickly did once we came out of our own little bubble!!!(jerks) \\n\\nAnyhow, our server was very knowledgeable on the wines they were currently offering and was constantly checking on us.\\n\\nThe food is delicious. We have since been back and find that it is.pretty enjoyable to sit at the bar which allows you to watch the chefs prep and cook all the food. So awesome!\\n\\nIts quaint in the winter, very warm and inviting and very light and breezy in the summer with their doors open leading to a gorgeous patio!\\n\\nI will always have fond thoughts of this place and.wish it all the success!,This place is fantastic! The atmosphere is upscale casual and has an awesome outdoor patio. The servers are amazing and knowledgeable about all of their wines that they offer. \\n\\nThe happy hour is totally worth it. I had the Rosemary and Mushroom pizza. The selections of the wine are vast! The prices are what you would expect from a wine bistro. It's a favorite of mine in Lakewood.,Completely obsessed with this place. I love trying new cheese every time I go. Great happy hour!,We sat at the open-kitchen side of the bar and the staff effortlessly chatted with guests as they prepared the food. One of the cheeses I ordered for a charcuterie ran out so they made it a point to let me sample the other options before ordering. A nice little sign they cared.\\nThe pizza is great(I had the spicy shrimp pizza), and the staff was very accommodating and friendly.\\nI'm not a huge wine guy, so I mainly went there for the food, but I was surprised at the alternative cocktail and beer list.\\nIt's a great place for a first date as well, but expect to drop a few clams.,It had been a long and extremely hot day. Humble Wine Bar was the perfect oasis! We had a very short wait on a Friday night. I wish I had made note of our server's name because she was awesome! I had scoped out the menu ahead of time, and was dining with a friend whom I consider to be an authority on all things Italian, cheese, and especially Napolitano style pizza. Being so tired and hungry, but also curious and wanting to make the most out of the experience, we ordered half the menu: stuffed peppadews appetizer (amazing!), salads, pick 3 cheese board, and a Margherita pizza. Everything was delish! We had leftovers, but not as much as you'd think. We were so hungry!\\nDue to being overheated, we stuck with non-alcoholic beverages, but I loved that they had a great selection of cocktails for non wine drinkers. I've only started to drink wine occasionally, but our server was so friendly that I wouldn't be intimidated to go back and explore the wine world at Humble.\\nLoved that there is a huge shared parking lot in the back. Be prepared that the bathroom is single serve, but it wasn't a problem.,My comments here are focused on the pizza which may not be fair because this place advertises as a wine bar.  I'm not a fan of craft beers (don't know when palates developed a taste for hops but that's all I taste these days with those beers.  I blame Sam Adams) so I won't grade them on libations.  Lastly, my pizza benchmark is entirely New York/New Jersey (my home base).  Humble has the tools--a nice looking brick oven (temperature was around 625 degrees which is a little low) but the execution is poor.  My friend had a sausage pie and I ordered one with sopressata. While we waited for our pies, we watched the cook furiously poking at the pies in the oven.  We asked the waitress what he was doing and learned that he was bursting any bubbles in the pies!  (Since they had to redo my pie, I was able to request that he not burst my bubbles).  What arrived were two very flat, thin and dense pies with no real character.  In both cases, cheese and sauce flavors were almost non existent. The sausage on my friend's pie was so finely ground it was almost invisible.  I was more fortunate as the sopressata was spicy and tasty.  Neither pie has any sort of rim.  And at $15 each, not a lot of value for the size.  I firmly believe that anyone looking to open a pizzeria should spend at least a week in Brooklyn going from place to place (starting and ending with Di Fara's) and tasting what truly excellent pizza tastes like.  If you prefer thicker pizza, then do the same road trip through Chicago.,I absolutely loved this place!  I came here with a friend for drinks and appetizers and it was the perfect spot for this.  They really embrace their love for wine and it is seen in their decor.  The place is modern and clean.  Behind the bar is a large hearth oven for baking their amazing flatbreads and there is plenty of room at the bar.  When we came here, it was chilly but they have a large outdoor patio area in the front of the restaurant, so I want to come back when its nice out.  \\nWe just missed their 4-6 happy hour, but if you can get there for it, DO IT!  Many of their specialty cocktails and wines by the glass are $5 and it is $2 off their flatbreads.  \\nWe ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio and split the Margarita pizza.  Both were amazing.  The wine was chilled and our server made sure that our glasses were never empty.  The pizza was thin crust and seasoned perfectly and large enough to share with someone.\\n\\nBetween the great wine, food, service and ambiance, I definitely plan to return.,I paid $8.50 for a glass of wine that was priced in a retail store at $8.95 per bottle. This place is ridiculously overpriced. The owner must think they are in New York City. Their happy hour only goes until 6:00 so it is impossible to make it there for a normal working person. The pizza was average, at best. I would not go here again unless I was forced.,I really do not understand how such bad food could happen to us at the place so highly praised by others. I had two trips to Humble bar - one with two of my girlfriends, where we had just drinks and dessert, and second with my husband. Being impressed by my first visit ( drinks and dessert were delicious), I came back to dive into the refreshingly different goodness of the place. In simpler words, we ordered artichoke appetizer and Margherita pizza both highly recommended by the waitress. While artichoke dish ( 2 artichokes stuffed with goat cheese and baked in the oven), was an interesting prelude to the meal, pizza ended up being a complete disaster. When I ordered Margherita pizza, I imagined the pizza described by Elizabeth Gilbert in \"Eat. Love. Pray\". Remember her eating this thin-crust delicious pizza in Rome? How she admits it was so sinful, but so good. \\nInstead we got ourselves a very dry, over-cooked, rubbery, blend far cry from the pizza. With the first bite, I got very confused: I was watching how they make pizza (you can see the entire process from the bar), I couldn't believe all that magic of pizza-making produced such garbage. I almost dislocated the jaw and take out the crown while eating it. And you would think, that something like this will never happen to you in a vey heart of Lakewood where gourmet pizza is sold at almost every corner. \\nBut it sure did. I still give place three stars for the atmosphere, service and quality booze ( the wine and apple cider we ordered were really good). \\nBut I won't be back. At least not for the pizza.,It's no wonder this wine bar got \"Best Wine Bar\" on Cleveland Scene's list!  We stopped here on a Saturday afternoon after exploring Lakewood for the first time and we loved it!  It was a beautiful day outside so we sat on the patio in the sun.  They have amazing long community tables on the patio and several smaller tables in the sun.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful - open air with big tables made from wine crates, a huge bar, and a stone oven!  The atmosphere of the place is perfect!\\n\\nAs for the food and the service - they were also perfect.  It was 3:00 in the afternoon so it wasn't too crowded.  We wanted just some light bites and I'm a huge sucker for a good meat and cheese plate.  Our server made recommendations for us and they were completely on point!  All the meat and cheese plates come with a baguette and everything crackers, mixed nuts, local honey, and fig jam.  Yummmmm!!  Their wine selection was great with awesome prices!  $7/glass of some wine we're looking for everywhere because of our waitress!?!?  We're dying to go back again for more - the pizzas look incredible and the salads look huge!!\\n\\nThanks for a great afternoon at Humble!!  :-),Let me start by saying I was very excited to have a wine bar come to Lakewood.  I was so excited that I kept giving Humble a try (3) times to be exact.  Not once can I say I had a pleasant experience.  All three times the hostesses were not great a greeting me.  In fact, I greeted them. Of course each time I chose to go was on a weekend so they are busy.  I always wait for a seat at the bar, which isn't to bad of a wait.  And why is it every time I am in this place the lady (I heard she is the manager or wife of the owner) is so super rude.  People started calling her the \"wine \"Nazi\". I actually saw someone move a bar chair over to talk to someone at the table and she yelled across the bar not to do that!! Ughh.  I decided to take my best friend to Humble a few weeks ago and she was so rude.  We received our pizza ( which was burnt so bad). We both tried it and didnt realize it until we took our first bite.  We looked at the bottom and it was black.  The ppl sitting next to us even said we should send it back.  So I call the ( blonde hair short cut) manager over and she insist it is not burnt and if she made another one for us it would turn out the same way???? Really?? So I said if you make me another one it will come out burnt?? Thankfully, the ppl who sat next to us said the pizza is burnt.. She just took it and made another one and was not happy about it.    Plus, there pizzas are over priced and not that great .  They say in the restraunt business that service and kindness go a long way.. I do not recommend this place to any of my friends or family or people I come in contact with.  Also when you go in plan on feeling smushed and pushed because it is way to tight in there. This maybe be a summer place to visit butbInplan on sticking to other wine places around Cleveland.,I've been monitoring the renovation of this place on facebook and was excited to check out the final product finally!  The space is really inviting, and super trendy - you feel like you're in some sort of chic Chicago bar that is trying to be upscale farm-to-table chic, when really you are in Lakewood, Ohio, which doesn't have to try to be farm-to-table and the Chicago-esque chic is a nice surprise. All sorts of confusing, but the end result is a decent wine bar for the up-and-coming Lakewood non-dive bar scene.  Unfortunately for me, this place was mobbed with people - which is awesome for the area and the restaurant, but not so awesome when you are hungry and have to wait over an hour for a table.  Luckily, you can buy a bottle of wine at the bar, and stand at a high top while you wait.\\n\\nAfter being seated, we ordered a cheese board with a choice of cheeses and meat, which was pretty delicious: we got prosciutto di parma, a raclette, and a blue cheese, which came with jam, honey, pistachios, and some fruit.  That being said, I was not super impressed by the depth or variety of the wine selection, and the pizza we ordered from the fancy behind-the-bar pizza oven was thick, chewy, and hard to eat.  The best part about the place, in my humble opinion (pun!), was the place itself - although super loud inside, it has lots of tables, lots of standing space by the bar, and a whole outdoor patio that is open in the summer via a garage door front that is so trendy nowadays.  Really, a great place to meet up with friends, share a bottle (or three), and snack on some food.  I wouldn't say that my dinner experience was great, but I think it will calm down once the initial opening-month frenzy is over, and maybe they will perfect their pizza techniques.  Street parking was not a problem (I got a spot right in front). Overall, looking forward to returning soon!,Deagan is doing it really well here. The menu is not as limited as I had heard and for doing only charcuterie, salad, small plates,  and pizza, there is quite a lot to choose from. My wife and I ordered 2 small salads, arugula and Caesar. I preferred her arugula but both were good. \\nWe then had the tuna puttanesca and it was definitely enough for us to share. It was nice and rare and not cut and done the way most restaurants do it.  \\nNext was the artichoke stuffed with goat cheese with a nice little prosciutto wrap on the end.  Be sure to eat that part too.  We both agreed it's probably one of the best artichoke appetizers we've ever had. \\nWe finished with a mushroom pizza with taleggio cheese.  Not as thin crusted as I expected but it didn't matter because it tasted great. \\n\\nThis was our first, long over due, visit to Humble Wine Bar, but we will be back here very, very soon.,I've had two experiences here. The first one was very good, good pizza and good drinks. \\n\\nI dined here tonight and was disappointed! We came a little late around 9:00, but we got a few drinks and I ordered the Roasted Beet salad. With the description \"roasted beet\" I expected just that - roasted beets. I got a plate of almost frozen cubed, canned beets. Don't get me wrong, I love cold beets so I ate them but I was completely thrown by the description. \\n\\nThe bartender was mostly MIA (there was a basketball game on so I guess that made focusing hard). When he was around, he was very nice and pleasant but hard to flag down. It was also not busy, less than half full, for a Saturday so I was pretty disappointed with the food and service. \\n\\nI will still give this place a chance, I would just suggest not going there past 8 PM because we got the B team. I have a 50/50 opinion of this place now!!,Always find out of 5 Stars great wine great help quiet environment nice patio strong recommendation,Went here after dinner for some wine and had a good experience. We sat at the bar and the service was great. The best part was watching the pizza guys. Tossing the dough masterfully and putting it into the pizza oven. Really fun to see. The menu is mostly pizza and I am yet to eat there, perhaps one day.,I Love the atmosphere here! Cozy, but with up beat music. My friend and I had several small plates. All were good. Notable were the brussel sprouts and pancetta wrapped shrimp. Our server was up beat and attentive. I hear that the pizzas are delicious.,I was in town visiting a friend and we came here with her boyfriend and two daughters.  There was something for everyone!  I loved the atmosphere and only wish it had been warmer so we could have sat outside.  We ordered the cheese plate, two pizzas (mushroom and margarita) and a couple of salads.  The happy hour prices were amazing and my friend and I each ordered a cocktail.  Our waitress was friendly, helpful and patient with us.,Finally! A wine bar in lakewood with decent food! I like rozis and their wine list, but the food kinda sucks. Humble has awesome food and wine. \\n\\nThe only reason it's four stars is I think our table was forgotten. That was a little communication mishap, and it was totally fine because it gave me time to catch up with the girls, so no big deal. Our waitress knew her wines pretty well and suggested a great gruner veltliner because I was craving white but know nothing about types. It was perfect! I really liked the rose too. I wish I had a wine tap. \\n\\nA friend and I split a margherita pizza and it was amazing. Like, one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Oh, and the place itself is awesome, just a little too loud for a wine bar.,Fantastic place. Large selection of wines. Very Mediterranean. Italian, but not like Olive Garden. Service was great. I had a Caesar salad, which does actually vome with anchovies. Which were the most flavorful part, could have used some salt and pepper or something. Then, I realized, this place reminded me of my short trip to Spain and France. And so I asked for some bread with oil & vinegar, and boom, they had it. Although the bread was sliced, which took some of the fun out of cracking open a baguette. But alas, a small complaint. A bit pricey if you're looking for something cheap. But it is a wine bar after all.,Personal review : more of a sports bar vibe than wine bar.  Loud & Minimal.  The owner wrote and questioned my last review.  Maybe I was harsh.  This place is not for me.,stop being so humble!!!! i love the giant pizza bubbles.,We tried several pizza and they were all great.  It does get loud inside, but they have a great patio.   All the wine bottles hanging from the ceiling are a really cool idea.,The service was terrible, maybe it was an off-night. I'm never one to complain so I can imagine others with lesser patience would've just left, but I stayed and ordered a drink with hopes that first impressions were incorrect, but it took so long to even get acknowledged for a menu that I didn't dare order food. (And I was sitting at their 2/3 empty bar!) The odd thing was, there were a couple tables with couples and a scatter 5 at the bar--much of the restaurant was empty, (the patio entirely empty)--so they certainly weren't understaffed for the evening and incapable of keeping up. It seemed like they just weren't in the mood to be there that particular evening. When I was finally given a menu, it was an unfriendly staff member that simply slid a menu to me without a single word, another staff member behind him whispered, \"sorry he will be back,\" I smiled and said, \"no worries,\" hoping to lighten them up, and I waited another 15 minutes just to get a glass of wine order in. I normally don't mind a wait, or even a wrong item received, but something about the lack of friendliness, and completely ignoring the customers while standing by the corner of the bar really rubbed me the wrong way. I drank the small glass as quickly as I could stomach to get my bill and get out of there. I regret going to this place.,We made our first visit to Humble Wine Bar last night for happy hour, and we really enjoyed our time there. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks (draft beer for the husband, a Limoncello cocktail for me) and pizzas (chicken pesto for him and vegan for me). \\n\\nWe both loved our pizzas, but my cocktail was terrible, which is why I am giving it four stars right now instead of five. It was so strong, I couldn't even drink it. After about three sips I was completely buzzed (yes, I am a bit of a lightweight anyway) and passed it over to my husband who also said it was not good (but proceeded to drink the rest). One of my pet peeves is bartenders who think they are doing you a favor by pouring a strong drink - I would rather enjoy it than have the skin burned off my esophagus. Next time, I will probably stick with wine. \\n\\nGreat atmosphere, nice staff, and we will definitely be returning. I will bump up the stars to five if I dare another cocktail and it is balanced!,First time here last night. I have to tell ya, it was incredible. Got the Moscow Mule, it was perfection! Came with friends and family. We all loved it. The vibe was great, it was mature, no crazy punks frolicking around. Decided late to get a pizza, just came from dinner elsewhere, and WOW, it was AMAZING! Perfectly done! And only took 7.5 min from time of order.\\nStaff were all extremely nice with smiles on their faces. I will be frequenting here!,The mushroom pizza is phenomenal! I've also tried the sausage and the chicken pesto, they're good but the mushroom is where it's at. I've had some really great wines here too. The ricotta dip and the humble pie were really good.\\n\\nIt's a good place to relax after a long day. It is loud on the inside (not the patio) but I heard that they have some professionals working out a solution so that should get better. I think they are eventually going to expand their menu too which would be nice for when a more hearty meal is what you're looking for.,I have been here 3 times! I have a rule that I will only try a place once and move on...there are so many great restaurants in Cleveland. However, I can't get enough of Humble - the pizza, cheese selection, wine, and service are all excellent. I hate artichokes, yet I get the chicken and artichoke pizza each time because it is that amazing! Go here and you will not be disappointed.,I've been twice now & have enjoyed both times. It has a very nice wine menu (though I have yet to get wine there), a great beer menu and I love their specialty cocktails. They have fixed the noise issue so it's easy to hear the person sitting across from you now. I also love that there is a large parking lot in the back! \\nIt's a small menu but personally I like smaller menus. It allows the chef to be more creative & the kitchen to focus on each dish going out. I've tried a variety of the pizzas since each time I've gone each person has gotten a different one. On recommendation from the knowledgable server my husband got the mushroom pizza on our last visit & it was Awesome! So many mushrooms and so much flavor. Definitely my favorite so far. But be sure to save room for dessert. Oh the wonderful desserts! The chocolate tower is amazing. And the creme brûlée inside of almond cake is not only brilliant but delicious. We will certainly go back often.,This is one of my favorite spots in Lakewood. They have a phenominal happy hour from 4-6. $5 martinis and they are great, I get a classic gin martini. Their charcuterie boards are also only $9 for 3 cheeses, crackers, house made bread, honey, and fig jam. Also, $2 off their flat breads. Their seasonable sangrias are the best. I recommend sitting at the bar. Enjoy!,Got the mushroom pizza tonight. It was delicious. The sprinkle of rosemary made this pizza 5 stars. I also appeciate how perfectly the crust is cooked...I am not into the trendy burnt taste and this pizza had NO burnt parts.\\n\\nMy only wish is that they had more red wine on tap. And maybe a sparkling shiraz.\\n\\nThe place is so clean, the white ceramic tile walls shine.\\n\\nNice place for a girls' night, date night, or just dinner/ wine.,Overall a nice location with good decor and quite possibly the worst pizza in Cleveland (including most frozen pizzas). Very surprised at how low quality and tasteless the pizza was. They need to change their dough and use better ingredients. Disappointed and will not be back.,Possibly one of the nicest casual restaurants we have been to!  Great atmosphere!  We had the clam/spinach pizza and it was the BEST!!!  We also had oysters on the half shell and bacon wrapped shrimp for starters.  Our wine of choice was Cambria Chardonnay 2013. It was amazing!  The service was wonderful.  All around a 5 star experience and we will for sure go back!,First the positives, great atmosphere, location, and staff.\\n\\nHowever, the food is average at best, and pricey for what you get.\\n\\nWe started with the Prosciutto Mozzarella Caprese, which was delicious, but you only get three little pieces of mozzarella for two large heirloom tomato slices, and one small tomato slice.  Maybe I am picky, but I want the ratio of tomato to cheese to be close.\\n\\nOverall the flavor and the taste of the pizzas are OK, but my biggest complaint is the pizza is thin and VERY HARD (save your \"The Office\" jokes, lol), especially the crust which was hard as a rock, and inedible.  I even asked the server if that maybe these pizzas were a bit overcooked and that the crusts were just unusually hard and dry, but she said that was the way their pizzas were.\\n\\nI think the atmosphere is nice, but not sure if I would go back to this place for any food.  Especially when there are so many great pizza places, this places falls flat to impress me with their pizza.,Greatvplace for a date or girls night out. Loved the wine selection and specialty drinks. The chicken pesto pizza was my favorite, wish I had room for dessert!,Tried this place out and was supremely let down. Poor service, rude hosts, and even ruder managers. Never going here again.,Although a wine bar is not my typical go to for a night out, I am so glad to have tried Humble! I am generally more of a \"what's the cheapest bottle of wine I can find at the grocery store?\" type of gal, so paying more than I generally pay for a bottle on a glass was a struggle for me. However, the wine was great and you can't beat the atmosphere. \\n     They have a great patio if the weather is nice and inside you can sit and watch them pull pizzas from the fire. Speaking of pizzas, they are a must try! My table mates and I got a few to share and I was not disappointed with any of the options. \\n     Overall, this place would make a great date spot, place to go with the girls, or just a fun dinner place. Either way, you will not be disappointed. This wine bar definitely has nothing to be humble about!,One of the best happy hours in town! I like that it's basically on my way home from work so that's a huge win for me. I love the HUGE parking lot in the back so you never have to worry about finding a parking spot. The decor inside is really modern meets wine country. I love the open fire when you can see the mouthwatering pizzas getting their gooey cheese. \\n\\nThe service here has always been pretty good. The hostess are always welcoming and friendly. The waiting staff is always on point. They have a great happy hour with pizza's, cheese board and delicious wine. My stud and I stopped in after work for some wine on the patio then two cheese boards and 2 glasses of wine each we finally decided to leave. \\n\\nIf you stop in for dinner, make sure to come before the dinner rush. The restaurant and patio aren't very big and it gets busy quick. If you stop in for happy hour, make sure you give yourself plenty of time because you are not going to want to leave.,They have wine on draft. I thought that was pretty odd so I tried it. I had the Malbec for $8. I sipped on the Pinot Noir my mom ordered and actually preferred the weird draft wine. This location was once Bob's Big Boy. After a fight at Kauffman Park around the year 1999, the Lakewood police showed up so I ran up the hill and hid in Bob's Big Boy and drank a milk shake. A few years later the location turned into Sakura and had hibachi. Lakewood vandals spray painted the little iconic Japanese waving kitties outside the hibachi place and it broke my heart. About 15 or so years later I am drinking draft wine with my mama ordering cheese plates and wood fired pizza at Humble. My mom complained about the acoustics of the place. I thought there were just a bunch of loud mouths around us. There are some interesting small plates for $5. We settled on the spicy eggplant dish which was decent. The gruyere cheese was good. It came with some crackers, mixed nuts, honey and fig spread. The pizza was very good. It was sort of a hybrid pizza and had many different traits and feels to it. I was expecting a paper thin, Neapolitan style margherita. Many places will simply use tomatoes instead of a sauce but Humble uses both. The sauce was flavorful without being bitter. The cheese was excellent and the crust was somewhat thick. I still prefer Crostatas for a true Neapolitan style yet this was so different that I could appreciate it for the uniqueness. I enjoyed the meal here and the service was excellent.,Humble has a really chill, but classy interior. We sat at the bar and our server was really nice and personable. She was able to answer our questions and provide recommendations on food and drinks. I got a julep and my girlfriend got the red sangria and the \"Violet\", both of which were delicious. We got the spicy pepperoni pizza and it was pretty good, nothing overly impressive but a pretty good pie made in their wood fire pizza oven. We will definitely be back for their good happy hour prices and the atmosphere. If you're a wine drinker I highly recommend Humble Wine Bar for their extensive wine selection and for their knowledgeable staff who take the time to pay attention to all the little details that make for a great glass of wine.,I went here just for drinks at the bar. I cannot say I got the full experience of this place. I would like to go back and sit at a table for a meal or snack. But when I was their, I did receive great service. Very tentative. The prices were really good here. I was shocked when I saw how low the bill was for my 2 drinks. I ordered 2 mix drinks and they were both good. I would come back here again.,Humble Wine Bar is an adorable and classy place with awesome happy hour deals! You can get a cheese board including 3 different types of cheeses for $10. My friend and I ordered a cheese board to share, along with a pizza, which is $2 off during happy hour. We also got some $5 cocktails to accompany our meal. The cheese plate we got was delicious, and our server was very helpful in giving us recommendations on the different cheeses. We also had the clam pizza and the Edgewater and Humble Sour cocktails. The clam pizza was not bad, but I think the cheese plate was definitely more memorable. The Edgewater cocktail was a little tart, but still sweet, and I really enjoyed it :)\\n\\nOverall, we had a really satisfying meal and our visit to Humble Wine Bar was a great one. There is also a giant parking lot right behind Humble, which is a huge plus! Convenient parking, great ambience and customer service, and delicious food - Humble is definitely worth a try!,The absolute CUTEST! Seriously, the atmosphere is the most cozy & adorable. This is the one place I wouldn't be mad about having to sit at the bar- it's so warm & inviting. The drinks are SO good that I would come just for drinks.. looks like they have a dope patio (I know where I'll be this summer!) I had the red sangria and some sort of lemony lavender concoction which was liquid heaven. Neither were too sweet and were flavored perfectly. The brussels sprouts were delicious and the added pancetta made the dish. We tried the 4 cheese pizza which tasted similar to cheesy bread and was super garlicy (which I loved.) There are a lot of good looking things on the menu and I cant wait to try them all. Counting down the days until my next visit....,Awful service!  I tried this place to give them a second chance and they were still the absolute worst! Please save yourself and don't go here,I was at Humble Wine Bar celebrating a friend's birthday. We had a bit of a larger group (6) so we called ahead to reserve a table only to discover that they don't take reservations. They assured us that Friday's were their busy day (it was Saturday) and that we shouldn't have trouble getting seated.\\n\\nFast-forward to our arrival and having to wait quite awhile to be seated. The hostess told us she couldn't give an accurate wait time because people like to hangout and sip on their wine - which is understandable. Luckily, we were able to find two open seats at the bar but there wasn't much room for standing and it felt like we were crowding. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated I ordered a glass of wine from the sparkling section of the wine list that was delicious! We ordered a selection of pizzas and some small plates for the table. The wine was great and our server gave some awesome recommendations, and the food was better than I expected as well. \\n\\nOur server was no where to be found for most of the meal so I never got a chance to sample a second glass of wine. Overall, the atmosphere was great and the menu didn't disappoint. I probably would have had a better experience if I went with a smaller group - Possibly a good place for a date night?,Had a wonderful night out with friends. It was quite busy but didn't notice the nearly hour wait while we had drinks at the bar.  Food was awesome. We had the Brussels sprouts and bacon wrapped shrimp and then the spinach and Brie pizza and the special of the night (chicken and basil with fresh tomato) all were fabulous! Can't wait to go back.,This is cousin to Deagan's Kitchen in Lakewood, so you know it's good!  Very cute date spot or girls night out.  The fireplace makes it nice and cozy inside.  I've been twice now and tried a few of the pizzas: Margherita, Lardo, and the Clam.  In all honesty, they were all really(!) good!  I recommend just ordering one that suits your tastes and I'm pretty sure you'll be impressed.  My last trip was with a group of 8 and everyone was very pleased.  Also on my last trip, I tried the Greek Salad, which calls out only Feta and a Red Wine Vinaigrette Dressing, but do not be fooled!  This salad is loaded with toppings, which I can appreciate.  It was very flavorful, though maybe a little heavy on the tapenade.  If you love olives, you'll love that salad.  Lots of wine options too.  Writing this review makes me want to go back right now so yeah, I definitely recommend!,Always a great place to go with the girls. Love the wine selection and shareable plates.,Stopped in for a glass of wine, stayed for dinner. Fantastic bartender, Sam, was kind and had great recommendations. Food was delicious, excellent beer and wine selection. \\n\\nGreat prices, super value. Wonderful to have a place in Lakewood that isn't another sports bar or burger joint.,Don't get me wrong Humble has a great happy hour  but that might be the extent of their charm. I really only go here during happy hour because the prices are right. Going at any other time isn't worth the cost of the items. They do have a decent wine selection and the cheese boards and pizza are tasty. If the prices were always happy hour I might come more often.,Cheers to Humble Wine Bar for elevating this strip of Lakewood's Detroit Avenue, (previously home solely to the strip-mall dregs of Drug Mart and Hollywood Video) to a hip and elegant dining milieu!\\n\\nThough I cannot speak to the kitchen's output, on a recent visit I was overwhelmingly impressed with the well-curated Wine List and gorgeous, charming interior! The front patio somehow lets you forget that you are sitting squarely street-facing; it is spacious, visually apart from the road, and well-appointed with deep picnic tables, hanging lights, and heaters.\\n\\nI would wholly recommend Humble as a date-night destination or a place to gather with girlfriends. I look forward to returning and sampling more of what they have to offer!,Great wines and great pizza. The oysters aren't bad either. My go to on a Friday night for some small plates and a quality bottle of vino. The patio is great during the spring/summer/fall months. Love Humble.,I went to Humble wine bar a couple of weeks ago with a group of friends. To say I was pleasantly pleased is an understatement. The cheese boards, meat boards, pizza, and dessert we had were all fantastic. The gluten free crust is really good. I'm already making plans to go back!,Ventured to Humble Wine Bar from Chardon on a recommendation and we were not disappointed! Arrived at 4 p.m., at the start of Happy Hour, and enjoyed delicious $5 cocktails, including the spicy red sangria - yum!\\n\\nPleasantly surprised by the size of the Charcuterie Board and quantity of the meats and cheese we selected - definitely filling for two people to share as a starter! Could easily feed 3-4. \\n\\nWe ordered two of the wood-fired pizzas - the Clam, which was savory and unexpectedly delicious (and not too heavy on the actual clam, if you're worried), and the Lardo, which - to our delight - had chunks of lardo (pig fat) melted onto the cheese. So. Good. Very salty, but on this occasion, it was just what we needed.,My review of \"HUMBLE\"....it isn't. Decent service,  the tomato/mozz caprese was good, the shrimp pizza we ordered underwhelming, the cream cheese brulee was not brulee at all. In short I say \"don't bother\".,Humble is fantastic! It tends to be VERY loud in there but the food is worth the noise. My friend and I had the Margarita pizza and Mushroom pizza. Both were amazing an I cannot wait to go back!!!!!,We always receive awesome service when we visit Humble, even during happy hour. To be honest a place that stops by 2 minutes before happy hour ends checking to make sure you don't want another drink at hh pricing deserves 5 stars solely based on that. However humble does better than that, the pizzas are fantastic and the selection of cheese for the cheese boards never disappoints. I love Humble and recommend you give it a go if you haven't before!!,Going three on the account of the pizza and their use of that beautiful wood fired oven. It has Soooooo much more potential. Sure it's good pizza. But it could be great. I don't think it matters cause the joints always packed. The wine list is killer the Brussel sprouts appetizer, delish. But give me a night with that oven, a bag of flour, salt, yeast, and time.... I'd take you to Italy. I think the pizziaolos need to hit the books and redesign their dough. It's your passport to Italy my friends! It's your canvas for your art. DaVinci didn't paint on cardboard.,Great addition to Lakewood! We didn't want to wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Great service and the pizzas were amazing - I ate every last bite of the crust and that never happens. They're thin but not too thin, and perfectly flavorful with that bit of wood-fired char on the bottom. We also had a Gouda cheese plate and the little sides of jam and nuts were perfect - great value for the five bucks. The interior is beautiful, although it was overly lit when we arrived so the ambience felt a little cold and also a bit loud. Regardless, we'll be back many, many times!,For as much as I come here I'm surprised it has taken me this long to write a review. I love Humble. I love Humble because it's sooo reliable. It's that perfect, local chill spot where you can go with friends or on a date and you know what you're getting yourself into.  You can expect good ambiance, a semi-quiet space for conversation, tasty food, friendly service and of course-- great wine! For food I usually go for the brussels, salmon crostini, or a cheese plate. People love the pizzas.  Right now I favor the Cava they have by the glass. My friend had a seasonal cocktail the other night that was delicious.\\nBe aware though they aren't open very late which is kind of a bummer.,This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. The pizzas are great, I've never once had a disappointing drink there, and they've had some excellent wines as their wine special for a very reasonable price. Only docked a star because the wait can be long and there's no where to sit while you wait, and the noise level can get a bit high. At the end of the day though, that's not enough to deter me, as I still regularly have a great experience here.,Spiced sangria was great. Good place for drinks & apps... Not really an entree type of place. The olives are a must.,Great weekday happy hour and nice patio to enjoy some good people watching. Wide selection of wine and very eclectic pizza menu. Definitely recommend the Spinach & Brie pizza is a must try!,The Décor is Outstanding ..  but the attitude left a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nTried out Humble second time around....  wow the hostess was rude ... sorry that our patronizing your restaurant was so off putting to you.  We went to the bar for a drink..  and the bartender She was no better.  It was such an imposition for her to serve us.  Not friendly at all.  \\n\\nBad Experience both times.  ..,What a cool spot!\\n\\nI dropped by on a balmy night and sat on the patio with a friend. I'd read reviews that talked about the noise level inside - when I walked in to get a table it was pretty loud inside. But the table of drunk ladies I ended up sitting next to outside were pretty loud too, so...\\n\\nI was intrigued by the wine on tap but I just HAD to get a Moscow Mule. It was perfect. I had to hand over my license to get a copper mug. I wish copper thieves would stop stealing mugs at bars. Leave 'em for the rest of us to enjoy, mmkay, folks?\\n\\nI was really excited to try the vegan sausage pizza. I've never eaten meat sausage, but I can tell you this pizza pie was really good. Loved the thin, slightly charred crust. The seitan sausage was flavorful, and despite my fears, the tofu cheese did have a good cheese flavor. 5 stars for the pizza!\\n\\nI think this place is an adorable place to meet up with some friends or to hang out for a date night. Minus one star for the noise level. Shouting over the traffic noise on Detroit and the drunk ladies next to me made the ambiance a little less awesome.,I went to Humble for a friends birthday party with a group of 6 on a Saturday night. Here was my experience... \\n\\nThe Up Side- The pizzas that we ordered were delicious and full of flavor. The menu includes several gourmet options that are unique and not your typical pizza topping combinations. All the pizzas were thin crust (my fav!) and had 6 slices. It was perfect for our group, we all ordered a different flavor and split so that we could try them all. If you are not starving, you could definitely split a pizza with 2 people, however it was also very good left over.\\n\\nThe Down Side-We went on a Saturday and it was very busy. We had to wait quite a while to get a table since many people were lingering and enjoying their wine (understandable). We waited at the bar, but there was only room for a few of us to actually get a seat and not much room inside to wait. Once we were seated our waitress took our orders for drinks, but took a long time to return for food orders and was relatively inattentive throughout the meal (again, I understand because it was busy). The pizza was also pretty pricey, about $13 each on average. \\n\\nI would return to Humble with a much smaller group, I think it would be ideal for a date night and if you are willing to relax and enjoy yourself while not in a time crunch. I also would like to try it out when the patio is open and check out the happy hour specials.\\n\\nIf you're looking for new pizza flavors to try and a glass of wine to go with it, this is your place!,This was my first visit to Humble and it was suggested by the beau.  We were excited because we actually were having a date during happy hours! \\n\\nWe walked in, saw the hostess, and were seated only to be informed that no, happy hour isn't for the \"dining\" area.  I'm confused by this because a.) it's freakin' happy hour b.) this place truly isn't big enough to be called a dining room c.) there is no real delineation between the bar and the \"dining\" area d.) uh...what is the name of this place again? Humble Wine BAR! \\n\\nWe moved to the bar and sat, and sat, and sat.  Again, I'm confused because there are 3 chicks standing at the end of the bar holding up the bar, but definitely not serving anyone.  Sam, the bartender finally greeted us.  He was nice, accommodating and running his rear off because for happy hour this \"Bar\" only stocked 1 bartender.  Brilliant.\\n\\nOn to the food / wine options.  Well... it was happy hour and I had 4 choices red, red, white, white.  Really?  Only 4 options.  Lame, guys.  While I enjoyed my glass, I would have selected others had there been options.  I'm sure you can cut the wine prices on more labels than 4 and still manage a profit.  Happy hour gets you $2 off any pizza, (most run $15-$17 without the discount), or a $9 cheese plate (enough for two but not much more).  The pizza we chose was the shrimp.  It was delicious!  I mean, REALLY good!  Humble is hitting on all 4 cylinders with this one!  I also had a nice salad with mixed greens.  The salad options all sounded wonderful (prices $7-$9).  I think overall, prices are a bit on the high side for my opinion of what this place is.    \\n\\nAll in all, I enjoyed myself (but that might have been the 3 glasses of wine I drank).  I'm not overly impressed with Happy Hour, but considering the regular prices, I'll be coming back for happy hour.   Service could be improved with more than one bartender.  And seriously Humble, you're a Wine BAR that means Happy Hour should extend to your entire establishment.,Lousy rude anti-social service! The blonde manager was sitting at the end of the bar in her work out sweat gear drinking her wine socializing with the staff while I waited simply for a smile from someone anyone! They served me a pour from an old bottle of wine [Austrian] and I paid for my over priced wine decided to scratch off my tip amd take my business elsewhere! Instead of spending my hard earned money to recieve lousy rude service I went next door to UpperCrust got my pizza went home where I know I will be treated nicely! \\nWho do they think they are at Humble Wine Bar? Definitley nothing Humble about them!\\nIf you have a problem with my true statements feel free to call me Karen at 216-906-4356! Learn som Humility and treat clients with respect and appreciation! \"Humble\" I think NOT!,This place was a pleasant surprise. We started with the cheese board which was excellent! We then ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza which we really enjoyed. Nice balance of sweet and salty. Love the atmosphere.,Ok..... if you're reading this please know for every negative review I always leave a positive one at another place I have recently visited. \\n\\n1) I recently moved to Lakewood and had family in visiting from the UK. We walked to Humble Wine Bar and I pulled my 3 year old along in his kiddie wagon. I had to change my sons diaper on the men's bathroom floor because there was no changing table??? Very surprising considering it's 2019, dads change diapers also. \\n\\n2) 80 minutes to wait for a flatbread. 80 minutes. \\n\\nI won't be back. I understand if \"wine bars\" are not accommodating to families. If that's the case tell me when we get there. \\n\\nI felt bad for the girl who was our server, she was very apologetic it definitely wasn't her fault. They seemed to hit a mad rush on a Wednesday night. But having worked in a kitchen previously, pizzas and flatbreads are a walk in the park! \\n\\nThey did not offer to comp our meal also which I found disappointing! \\n\\nOne and done!,Went to Humble for dinner on a Wednesday night and I'm honestly a little mad I waited so long to give this place a try! A few friends and I sat on the patio since it was such a nice night, which is really cute with picnic-style tables and string lights. They have a great wine selection both by the glass and by the bottle. But what won me over was the pizza! I ordered what I thought would be a safe, standard choice - the Margherita pizza- but I was wrong. It was much better than \"standard\"! So much flavor, nice crispy crust. I tried both of my friends pizzas too (Spinach Brie and the sausage pizza) and both were equally as delicious. I'd highly recommend Humble for dinner with friends, date night or really any occasion.,Our favorite place to go on date night.   Excellent service, drinks and wine selection.  Pizzas are amazing.  Try the shrimp pizza,My mom and I had a great time at Humble! The place was adorable and we were seated right away. Our waitress was super helpful and was spot on with recommendations. We were able to sample some of the different wines before we got a glass. We also got one of their cheese platters and it was fantastic. The ratio of meat, cheese and preserves was a little off but it tasted amazing. This place is a bit pricer but totally worth it. We hope to come back soon!,Yummy salad and pizza. Great atmosphere. Very fresh and fun drink menu. Great event venue as I was here for a baby shower. Seems great if you want to sit outside and also if you bring kids.,I love to visit Humble every time I'm in Cleveland. The food is good and the prices are decent (especially during happy hour). I'd recommend stopping by for pizza and a glass or two of wine!,Pizza, Oysters & Wine. What more could a guy ask for. My wife and I come up here every once and awhile for days night and it is always a hit. We will occasionally bring the kids, but we prefer it just being us. Great atmosphere and food. Service is always a hit or miss.\n",
